# Ticket Purchase Issue Debug Guide

## 🔍 Issue Analysis

Based on your description, the **EventDetail component is correctly working** - it shows "Tickets will be available soon" when `event.ticket_types` is empty. This suggests that **events in the database don't have associated ticket_types**.

## 🏗️ Database Structure

The database has the following relevant tables:

### Events Table (`public.events`)
- Stores basic event information
- Has relationship to `organizers` and `venues`
- Key fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `organizer_id`, `venue_id`

### Ticket Types Table (`public.ticket_types`) 
- Stores ticket options for each event
- Foreign key: `event_id` → `events.id`
- Key fields: `id`, `event_id`, `name`, `price`, `quantity_available`, `quantity_sold`, `is_active`

### The Problem
Events exist in the database, but they have **no associated ticket_types records**, causing the EventDetail component to correctly display "Tickets will be available soon".

## 🛠️ Debug Tools

I've created several tools to help you identify and fix this issue:

### 1. `debug-database.js`
- Connects to your Supabase database
- Checks for events and their ticket types
- Provides detailed analysis of the issue
- **Update the SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY** before running

```bash
node debug-database.js
```

### 2. `debug-event-service.js`
- Tests the exact same query used by `EventService.getEventById`
- Simulates the EventDetail component logic
- Shows why "Tickets will be available soon" appears
- **Update credentials** before running

```bash
node debug-event-service.js
```

## 🔧 Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Sample Events with Tickets (Recommended)
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and run the contents of add-sample-events.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ 1 test organizer
- ✅ 1 test venue  
- ✅ 3 sample events (Championship, Workshop, Virtual Masterclass)
- ✅ 7 ticket types across the events

### Solution 2: Add Tickets to Existing Events
If you want to keep existing events, run:

```sql
-- Copy and run the contents of add-tickets-to-existing-events.sql
```

This automatically adds appropriate ticket types to existing published events based on their category.

### Solution 3: Create Events with Tickets (JavaScript)
If you prefer using JavaScript:

```bash
# Update credentials in the file first
node create-test-events.js
```

### Solution 4: Manual Admin Interface
Use your admin interface to:
1. Find events without ticket types
2. Add ticket types manually for each event

## 🎯 EventDetail Component Logic

The EventDetail component checks this condition on line 472:

```typescript
{Array.isArray(event.ticket_types) && event.ticket_types.length > 0 ? (
  // Show ticket purchase options
) : (
  // Show "Tickets will be available soon"
)}
```

When `event.ticket_types` is `null`, `undefined`, or empty array, it shows the "available soon" message.

## 🔍 Database Query Analysis

The `EventService.getEventById` method uses this query:

```sql
SELECT *,
  organizers (...),
  venues (...),
  ticket_types (
    id, name, description, price, 
    quantity_available, quantity_sold, is_active
  )
FROM events 
WHERE id = ?
```

If no ticket_types exist for an event, the `ticket_types` field will be empty.

## ✅ Verification Steps

After implementing a solution:

1. **Check Database**: Run `debug-database.js` to verify ticket types exist
2. **Test Frontend**: Visit an event detail page - you should see ticket purchase options
3. **Test Purchase Flow**: Try adding tickets to cart and proceeding to checkout

## 🚨 Key Findings

- ✅ EventDetail component is working correctly
- ✅ Database schema is properly set up
- ❌ Events lack associated ticket_types records
- 🎯 Solution: Add ticket_types to existing events or create new events with tickets

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Choose one of the solutions above
2. Run the appropriate script/SQL
3. Test the ticket purchase flow
4. Verify users can now buy tickets

The issue is purely a **data problem** - once ticket types are added to events, the purchase flow should work perfectly!

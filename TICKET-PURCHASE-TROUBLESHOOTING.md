# Ticket Purchase Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® "Could not establish connection" Error

If you're seeing the error `"Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist"` when trying to buy tickets, this is typically caused by **browser extension interference**, not an issue with the SteppersLife website.

### ‚úÖ Quick Fixes (Try these first)

#### 1. **Use Incognito/Private Mode**
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) 
- **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Shift+N`
- Try purchasing your ticket in incognito mode
- ‚úÖ **If this works**, you have a browser extension conflict

#### 2. **Clear Browser Data**
- Go to your browser settings
- Clear browsing data for **stepperslife.com**
- Include: Cookies, Cache, Site Data
- Try the purchase again

#### 3. **Disable Extensions Temporarily**
- Go to your browser's extension settings:
  - **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions/`
  - **Edge**: `edge://extensions/`
  - **Firefox**: `about:addons`
- Turn off all extensions
- Try the ticket purchase
- ‚úÖ **If this works**, re-enable extensions one by one to find the culprit

## üîç Common Problematic Extensions

### Shopping & Coupon Extensions
- **Honey** üçØ
- **Capital One Shopping**
- **Rakuten**
- **InvisibleHand**
- **Coupon Companion**

**Why they interfere**: These extensions inject scripts into checkout pages to find coupons, which can conflict with payment processing.

### Ad Blockers
- **uBlock Origin**
- **AdBlock Plus**
- **AdBlock**
- **Ghostery**

**Why they interfere**: They may block payment processing scripts or analytics that are required for the checkout process.

### Privacy Extensions
- **Privacy Badger**
- **DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials**
- **Disconnect**

**Why they interfere**: They can block tracking scripts that payment processors use for fraud detection.

### Password Managers (Sometimes)
- **LastPass**
- **1Password**
- **Dashlane**

**Why they interfere**: Auto-fill scripts can sometimes conflict with form validation.

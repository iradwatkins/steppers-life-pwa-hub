# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Manual Execution Required

**Important**: These commands must be executed manually by you, as I cannot access production systems for security reasons.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Code Preparation (COMPLETE)
- [x] 3-tier event system implemented
- [x] RSVP system removed
- [x] Follower sales restrictions clarified
- [x] Build successful (no errors)
- [x] Integration testing complete

### ⏳ Database Preparation (YOUR ACTION REQUIRED)
```bash
# 1. BACKUP YOUR PRODUCTION DATABASE FIRST
# Create a backup before running migrations

# 2. Run migrations in order:
cd /Users/irawatkins/Documents/Cursor\ Projects/steppers-life-pwa-hub
npx supabase migration up --environment production
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# Execute these commands in your terminal:

# Navigate to project
cd "/Users/irawatkins/Documents/Cursor Projects/steppers-life-pwa-hub"

# Run the migrations (this will execute both):
# - 20250628000000_remove_rsvp.sql (removes RSVP)  
# - 20250627000000_add_event_types.sql (adds 3-tier system)
npx supabase migration up
```

### Step 2: Build Application
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Verify build completed successfully
# Should show: "✓ built in X.XXs"
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Hosting Platform

#### If using Vercel:
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
npx vercel --prod
```

#### If using Netlify:
```bash
# Deploy to Netlify
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

#### If using other hosting:
```bash
# Upload the contents of the 'dist/' folder to your hosting provider
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Critical Tests to Run:
1. **Simple Events**: Create a new Simple Event
2. **Ticketed Events**: Test ticket purchasing flow
3. **Premium Events**: Verify seating charts work
4. **Follower Sales**: Check BMAD restrictions
5. **Payment Processing**: Test Square/PayPal/CashApp

### Quick Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check if site is accessible
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Check if API endpoints respond
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

## 🆘 Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### Database Rollback:
```bash
# If you need to rollback migrations:
npx supabase migration down --count 2
```

### Code Rollback:
- Redeploy previous version from git
- Or use hosting platform's rollback feature

## 📊 Monitoring After Deployment

### Key Metrics to Watch:
- [ ] Error rates in application logs
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Payment processing success rates
- [ ] User registration/login rates
- [ ] Event creation rates

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- ✅ Simple Events available in event creation
- ✅ RSVP options completely removed
- ✅ Ticketed Events working normally
- ✅ Premium Events with seating intact
- ✅ Follower sales show "Individual Tickets Only"

**READY TO DEPLOY**: All code changes are complete and tested. 
**YOUR ACTION REQUIRED**: Execute the commands above manually.

## 🔐 Security Note

I cannot execute these commands for you because:
- Production database access requires your credentials
- Deployment platforms need your authentication
- This protects your systems from unauthorized access

You have full control over when and how to deploy these changes.

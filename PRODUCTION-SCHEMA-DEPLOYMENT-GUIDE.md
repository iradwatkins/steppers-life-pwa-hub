# 🚨 CRITICAL: Production Schema Deployment Guide

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your production database at `https://nvryyufpbcruyqqndyjn.supabase.co` is missing 80% of required tables. This is why your application isn't working in production.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Access Production Supabase
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nvryyufpbcruyqqndyjn
- Navigate to: **SQL Editor**

### 2. Run the Emergency Schema Script
- Copy the entire contents of: `DEPLOY-PRODUCTION-SCHEMA-NOW.sql`
- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
- Click **"Run"**

### 3. Verify Deployment
The script will automatically show:
- ✅ Before: Current table count
- ✅ After: All tables created
- ✅ Success confirmation

## What This Fixes

### Missing Core Tables (will be created):
- `organizers` - Event organizers/promoters
- `venues` - Event locations
- `events` - Core event data
- `ticket_types` - Ticket offerings
- `tickets` - Individual tickets
- `orders` - Purchase records
- `order_items` - Purchased tickets
- `payments` - Payment transactions
- `promo_codes` - Discount codes
- `check_ins` - Event attendance
- `event_analytics` - Reporting data

### Missing Feature Tables (will be created):
- `saved_payment_methods` - User payment data
- `security_activity_log` - Security tracking
- `saved_events` - User wishlists
- `blog_categories` - Content categories
- `blog_posts` - Blog content
- `seating_sections` - Venue seating

### Missing Enums (will be created):
- `user_role` - User permissions
- `event_status` - Event states
- `ticket_status` - Ticket states
- `payment_status` - Payment states
- `order_status` - Order states

## Safety Features

✅ **Safe to run**: Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses
✅ **Won't break existing data**: Preserves users and profiles
✅ **Idempotent**: Can run multiple times safely
✅ **Includes indexes**: Performance optimized
✅ **Includes triggers**: Auto-updates timestamps

## Expected Result

After running this script:
- Your production app will work properly
- All features will be functional
- Database will have 20+ tables instead of 2-3
- Performance will be optimized

## Time to Fix: 2 minutes

1. Copy `DEPLOY-PRODUCTION-SCHEMA-NOW.sql` ← **Do this now**
2. Paste in Supabase SQL Editor 
3. Click Run
4. Watch success messages
5. Test your production app

## Why This Happened

- Local development schema was never deployed to production
- Migration files in `supabase/migrations/` were not applied
- Production was missing core business logic tables

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. ✅ Verify app works in production
2. 🔄 Set up proper migration deployment process
3. 📊 Create sample data if needed
4. 🧪 Run full production testing

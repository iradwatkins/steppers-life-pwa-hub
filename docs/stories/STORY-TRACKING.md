## BMAD COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

✅ **Business Analysis:** Accurate assessment of current state  
✅ **Method:** Evidence-based status tracking with complete file inventory  
✅ **Architecture:** Clear technical requirements identified  
✅ **Development:** Realistic timeline provided  
✅ **Sequential Epic Numbering:** All epics A-P (no gaps)  
✅ **Story File Completion:** All 54 story files exist

## NEXT PHASE: SYSTEMATIC BMAD IMPLEMENTATION

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Begin Story Implementation** (Fresh Start)

## VERIFIED COMPLETED STORIES (BMAD AUDIT):

**B.001: Authentication** ✅ **B.002: Checkout Flow** ✅ **B.003: E-Ticket Display** ✅

## CRITICAL BMAD COMPLIANCE ISSUE:
❌ **Individual story files have NOT been properly marked with completed tasks/subtasks**
❌ **Must go back and check off ALL acceptance criteria, tasks, and subtasks in each .story.md file**

## IMMEDIATE BMAD ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Update B.001.story.md - mark all ACs, tasks, subtasks as completed
2. Update B.002.story.md - mark all ACs, tasks, subtasks as completed  
3. Update B.003.story.md - mark all ACs, tasks, subtasks as completed
4. Then proceed with proper BMAD methodology for next stories

## BMAD RULE VIOLATION IDENTIFIED:
- Story tracking updated but individual story files NOT updated
- This violates BMAD systematic completion requirements
   - Follow BMAD methodology: one story at a time
   - Complete all tasks before moving to next story
   - Maintain documentation compliance

3. **Epic Completion**
   - Complete all stories within each epic
   - Validate epic acceptance criteria
   - Update tracking documentation

**APPROACH: BMAD-compliant sequential development**

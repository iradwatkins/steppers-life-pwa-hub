# SteppersLife PWA - Cursor Rules

## Project Foundation Rules
- Follow BMAD methodology strictly - switch between Scrum Master and Developer personas as needed
- Use Technical Preferences as source of truth over any conflicting documentation
- Start simple, scale when necessary - avoid over-engineering

## Tech Stack Enforcement
- Framework: React + Vite + TypeScript ONLY
- Styling: Tailwind CSS ONLY (no CSS-in-JS)
- UI Components: shadcn/ui ONLY
- Backend: Supabase BaaS ONLY (no Express/NestJS)
- State: Start with useState/useEffect, scale to TanStack Query if needed
- PWA: vite-plugin-pwa ONLY

## Authentication Rules
- Email/password authentication ONLY
- Google OAuth ONLY (no Facebook/Apple)
- Magic link authentication ONLY
- Use Supabase Auth exclusively

## Code Organization
- Use monorepo structure
- Feature-based directory organization when scaling
- Co-locate tests with components
- Follow TypeScript strict mode

## Development Process
- Developer takes notes for Scrum Master
- Document recurring issues in *italics* to prevent repetition
- Major unresolved issues go in technical documentation
- All learnings must be exportable for future projects

## Story Implementation
- Break large stories into smaller, manageable pieces
- Complete all acceptance criteria before moving to next story
- Validate against technical preferences before implementation
